We are studying industrial economy and technology management (INDØK) 
in the 3rd year. Sabina's specialization is in Data science and Johan's is in
product development. 

### Project description
This program will initialize an island where herbivores and carnivores live. 
Defined by the parameters set, the simulation will visualize where and how many 
carnivores and herbivores are living at a certain place at a given time.
